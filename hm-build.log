Oops, Nix failed to install your new Home Manager profile!

Perhaps there is a conflict with a package that was installed using
"nix profile add"? Try running

    nix profile list

and if there is a conflicting package you can remove it with

    nix profile remove {number | store path}

Then try activating your Home Manager configuration again.
